# Pothole EDA and Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for exploring and classifying road potholes using image data. The dataset used in this project is the "IIT Goa Pothole Detection & Classification Dataset," which is designed for comprehensive road pothole detection and threat level assessment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to set up your environment and understand the structure of the dataset.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- os
- cv2 (OpenCV)
- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas opencv-python matplotlib numpy seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of image files and a CSV file that contains information about each image. The CSV file has the following columns:

- `Image ID`: The unique identifier for each image.
- `Pothole`: A binary label indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of a pothole.
- `Number of Potholes`: The number of potholes in the image.
- `Level`: A categorical variable representing the threat level.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The Jupyter notebook provided in this repository includes code for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. You can use this notebook to gain insights into the data, visualize it, and make informed decisions about preprocessing and modeling.

## Binary Classification

One of the tasks in this project is binary classification to predict the presence or absence of potholes. The code and steps for binary classification are included in the notebook. It covers the following key points:

- Preprocessing the data.
- Creating a binary classification model.
- Training and evaluating the model.
- Visualizing the results with a confusion matrix.

## Multiclass Classification

Another task in this project is multiclass classification to assess the threat level of potholes. The notebook also includes code for multiclass classification. It covers the following aspects:

- Preprocessing the data for multiclass classification.
- Creating a multiclass classification model.
- Training the model to predict threat levels.
- Visualizing the results with a confusion matrix.

## Usage

You can use the provided Jupyter notebook to run the code and analyze the data. Make sure to customize the code and parameters to fit your specific requirements and dataset.
